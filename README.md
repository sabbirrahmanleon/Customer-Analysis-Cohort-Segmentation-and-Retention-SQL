# Customer-Analysis-Cohort-Segmentation-and-Retention-SQL
In this project, I explored customer lifetime value segmentation, cohort-based revenue trends, and retention dynamics using raw SQL and PostgreSQL. This hands-on analysis helped me identify high-impact customer segments, evaluate revenue evolution across years, and measure churn behavior in detail.


ðŸ“Š Highlights:

â€¢ Segmented customers into High, Mid, and Low Value based on LTV

â€¢ Analyzed customer revenue by cohort year (2015â€“2024)

â€¢ Assessed retention vs churn across cohorts with SQL-powered insights

â€¢ Delivered strategic recommendations based on data-driven findings

ðŸ’¡ This project sharpened my SQL skills and deepened my understanding of customer lifecycle metrics.
